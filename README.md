# Simple Survey Form

## Survey form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### About: 

I developed a sign-up form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form has fields for first name, last name, phone number, email, and password, as well as a submit button. The formâ€™s design is created using HTML and CSS, while JavaScript is used to validate the form inputs and password. The form is both responsive and interactive. This project allowed me to enhance my web development skills and gain a better understanding of how to use JavaScript for form input and password validation.
